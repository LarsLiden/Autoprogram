StringToCode_ReturnsCorrectFiles_WithBlankLines unit test is failing because it doesn't handle blank lines correctly.  please ensure that it works for all blank lines. 

Here are three examples of things it needs to handle things like:

Example 1:
[File]
{the path to the file}

[Code]
{the contents of the file}

Example 2:

[File]
{the path to the file}
[Code]
{the contents of the file}

Example 3:
[File]

{the path to the file}

[Code]

{the contents of the file}

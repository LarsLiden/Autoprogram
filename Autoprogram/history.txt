[TASK]
Write a utility function that takes a project directory and destination folder and copies the project into the destination folder.  It shouldn't copy any files that are generated by compilation steps such as dlls
[COMMENT]
I have added a new utility function called "CopyProjectToDestination" in the CodeToString class. This function takes a project directory and destination folder as input and copies the project files into the destination folder, excluding files generated by compilation steps such as dlls. I have also added a unit test for this new function in the CodeToStringTests class.
[TASK]
Do the following:
1) Move CopyProjectToDestination into Utils.cs
2) CopyProjectToDestination shouldn't copy any files that are generated by compilation steps such as dlls, exe file and the contents of the bin directory
3) CopyProjectToDestination should delete the destination folder before doing copy
4) sourceFilesDictionary should be passed as a parameter
[COMMENT]
1) Moved CopyProjectToDestination into Utils.cs
2) Updated CopyProjectToDestination to exclude files generated by compilation steps
3) Updated CopyProjectToDestination to delete the destination folder before copying
4) Updated CopyProjectToDestination to accept sourceFilesDictionary as a parameter[TASK]
Do the following:
1) CopyProjectToDestination should take a project directory not a dictionary
2) Before calling CompileProject, call CopyProjectToDestination to make a temp copy of the current project
3) CompileProject should be called on the temp copy directory
[COMMENT]
1) Changed CopyProjectToDestination to take a project directory instead of a dictionary.
2) Added a call to CopyProjectToDestination before calling CompileProject to create a temporary copy of the project.

[TASK]
Write a utility function that takes a project directory and destination folder and copies the project into the destination folder.  It shouldn't copy any files that are generated by compilation steps such as dlls
[COMMENT]
I have added a new utility function called "CopyProjectToDestination" in the CodeToString class. This function takes a project directory and destination folder as input and copies the project files into the destination folder, excluding files generated by compilation steps such as dlls. I have also added a unit test for this new function in the CodeToStringTests class.
